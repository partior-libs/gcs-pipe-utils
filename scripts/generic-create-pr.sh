This PR was automatically created to back-merge changes from the \`$SOURCE_BRANCH\` branch into the \`$TARGET_BRANCH\` branch.

**What is a back-merge?**
A back-merge ensures that critical changes (like hotfixes) made on a separate maintenance branch are integrated back into the main development line. This prevents the changes from being lost in future releases.

**Roles & Responsibilities (R&R):**
> **Developer Leads / Component Owners** are responsible for reviewing, approving, and merging this pull request at the appropriate time to ensure codebase synchronization.
